### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a twenty-one-two-old aerospace Master's student looking to expand his horizons. I lived in Lisbon, Portugal until recently but moved to Munich, Germany to do my Master's. Adventurous and eager to learn, I have let myself be charmed by humanity's biggest unknown. Since I can remember, Space has been my passion and motivation to thrive through education. In the pursuit of answers for both myself and humankind, I hope to contribute and positively impact this cause. I find myself easy-going, always energic, and willing to work, but able to remain calm and reasonable when problems arise. After completing my Bachelor's I have discovered new passions for Automatic Control and Spacecraft Propulsion.
